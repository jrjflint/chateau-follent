# Security Policy

Thank you for helping protect the digital presence of Lord James Follent. This
policy explains how to report potential vulnerabilities affecting the Chateau
Follent project and what to expect once a report is submitted.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Email: [security@chateaufollent.com.au](mailto:security@chateaufollent.com.au)
- Subject line: `Vulnerability Report – Chateau Follent`
- Include a detailed description of the issue, steps to reproduce, affected
  assets or URLs, and any supporting evidence (screenshots, logs, proof of
  concept code).
- If the issue involves sensitive tunnel or credential material, encrypt the
  report using the team PGP key referenced in the private credential vault.

## Response Expectations

1. **Acknowledgement** – We aim to respond within five business days to confirm
   receipt and outline next steps.
2. **Assessment** – The security working group led by Lord James Follent will
   triage the report, assign an owner, and determine severity.
3. **Remediation** – We will coordinate with you on fix timelines, seeking
   clarification where needed and keeping you informed until resolution.
4. **Disclosure** – Please refrain from public disclosure until a fix is
   deployed. We are happy to credit researchers with permission from Lord James
   Follent once remediation is complete.

## Safe Harbour

We will not pursue legal action against researchers who make a good faith effort
to comply with this policy, avoid privacy violations, and give us reasonable
notice before disclosure.

## Scope

This policy covers:

- The Chateau Follent GitHub repositories and associated infrastructure managed
  by Lord James Follent.
- Preview environments served through the Cloudflared tunnel described in this
  repository.
- The public website and any first-party services listed in the third-party
  script register.

Thank you for safeguarding Lord James Follent's digital estate.

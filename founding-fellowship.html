        <p>
          The <strong>Founding Fellowship of Château Follent</strong> is the first and most honoured tier of the Château Follent membership. Limited to a small company of early believers — a Fellowship in the truest sense — this club represents the original companions who set out on the journey with the House of Follent from its very first vintage.
        </p>
        <p>
          This isn’t merely a wine club.<br />
          It is an <strong>order</strong>, a <strong>circle</strong>, a <strong>band of founders</strong> bound together by craft, story, and the shared belief that great things begin small — with courage, creativity, and good company.

        <h2 id="why-exists-heading">Why the Founding Fellowship Exists</h2>
        <p>The Founding Fellowship exists to:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Honour those who walk with Château Follent from the very beginning</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Offer first and best access</strong> to our earliest and most limited releases
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Record the names of our companions</strong> in the story of the First Vintage
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          By joining the Fellowship, you are woven into the founding chapter of Château Follent — not as a spectator, but as a recognised companion.

        <h2 id="limited-company-heading">A Limited Company of Twenty-Five</h2>
        <p>
          The Fellowship is <strong>strictly limited</strong> to a small and select company, chosen in the spirit of wisdom, friendship, and shared delight in wine.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>In this First Age, the company shall number <strong>twenty and five (25)</strong></li>
          <li>These shall be known forever as <strong>The Founding Fellowship</strong></li>
          <li>Once claimed, a place in the Fellowship endures until freely relinquished</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Your membership is not just a subscription. It is a seat at the table of the House of Follent in its earliest days.

            <li><strong>12 bottles per year</strong> – for those who wish to journey deeper into the cellar</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Each allocation is drawn from the cellar of Château Follent and is known as your <strong>Chapter Release</strong>, marking each year of your Fellowship, as vineyards mark the passing of seasons.

# Marketing Link References

To support QR code placements on bottle labels while keeping attribution consistent with Lord James Follent's preferred salutation, store the canonical campaign links in this document.

## 2025 Moscato QR label
- **Landing page:** `vintages.html` anchor for the 2025 Moscato log entry (`#wine-2025-moscato`).
- **Example URL:** https://chateaufollent.com.au/vintages.html?utm_source=qr&utm_medium=label&utm_campaign=2025-moscato#wine-2025-moscato
- **UTM conventions:**
  - `utm_source=qr` — indicates the acquisition channel is a scannable QR mark.
  - `utm_medium=label` — differentiates bottle labels from other placements (e.g., postcards).
  - `utm_campaign=2025-moscato` — ties reporting directly to the 2025 Moscato production run stewarded by Lord James Follent.

Embed the URL above within the QR code artwork to drive tasters straight to the Moscato production snapshot on the vintages archive.

        imagination. Follow Lord James Follent’s journey from IT professional to
        winemaker, blending patience, legacy, and creativity to craft wines that

          <h2>1. Origins — The Ordinary World</h2>
          <p>
            Before the first grapes were pressed, Lord James Follent lived in a
            world of code and logic. Working in IT and immersed in gaming, he
            spent his days solving problems through screens — until his fiancée
            gently suggested he find a hobby that existed offline. That moment
            planted the first seed of curiosity, though the soil for it had yet
            to be found.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              “Every legacy begins with a single question — what if I made
              something real?”
            </p>
          </blockquote>
        </section>

          <h2>2. Awakening — The Call to Adventure</h2>
          <p>
            Christmas 2019 became the turning point. Lord James Follent opened a
            raffle-won bottle at lunch, only to be asked, “Why that one now?”
            Then came a well-aged bottle from the family cellar — a revelation in
            patience and craft. That taste awakened something enduring. By 2020,
            he was collecting and cellaring Australian wines, studying terroirs,
            and exploring the artistry that turns time into flavour.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>“Wine taught me that patience is a form of imagination.”</p>

          <h2>3. Becoming — Crossing the Threshold</h2>
          <p>
            For years, space was the barrier. Living in an apartment meant the
            dream of winemaking remained theoretical. But in 2023, moving into a
            home changed everything. At last there was room to experiment — to
            crush, press, and ferment. The first vintage of 2024 brought Pinot
            Noir and Shiraz, made with friends and guided by curiosity. The dream
            had crossed into reality.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>“A door opened, and on the other side was the scent of fermentation.”</p>
          </blockquote>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>4. Apprenticeship — Tests, Allies &amp; Mentors</h2>
          <p>
            Guided by Jeff Aston at Tractorless Vineyard, Lord James Follent
            learned by doing. He joined the Sydney Amateur Winemakers Club,
            gaining mentors, peers, and a community of patient tinkerers. Each
            challenge — from managing ferment temperature to refining balance —
            became part of a larger education in humility and craft.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              “The greatest vintages are made in the company of those who share
              the journey.”
            </p>
          </blockquote>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>5. Heritage — The Revelation of Identity</h2>
          <p>
            As the craft deepened, so did the connection to ancestry. The family
            name — once Follette, then Follett, later Follent — told a story of
            adaptation across centuries and continents. Naming the project
            Château Follent became a tribute to that lineage, a way to honour
            both origin and evolution through creativity.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>“Heritage is not something you inherit — it’s something you continue.”</p>
          </blockquote>

          <h2>6. Persona — The Transformation</h2>
          <p>
            The figure of Lord James Follent emerged — not as nobility, but as
            narrative. It represents stewardship, patience, and a belief in
            legacy over haste. The courtesy title is used as a gesture of
            imagination and respect for tradition, embodying the timeless virtues
            that define both wine and character.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>“Titles fade; stewardship endures.”</p>

          <h2>7. Legacy — The Return with the Elixir</h2>
          <p>
            Today, Château Follent is more than a label — it’s a living story.
            Through winemaking, storytelling, and hospitality, Lord James Follent
            shares what patience has taught him: that beauty takes time,
            generosity multiplies joy, and heritage can be renewed through craft.
            Each bottle is an invitation to slow down, taste deeply, and imagine
            your own legacy.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>“The true elixir is not in the bottle, but in what it inspires.”</p>
